# MPS Interoperability

The goal of this project is to permit interoperability with MPS model from outside MPS. 

## MPS Loading

This API permits to load MPS nodes and MPS language definitions in Kotlin.

## Supported platforms

For now we target the JVM but we could in the future convert to a Kotlin multi-platform project, so that it can be run in the browser and in all the platforms supported by Kotlin/native.
